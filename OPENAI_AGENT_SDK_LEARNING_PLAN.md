def validate_payment_request(user_input: str) -> bool:
    # SDK-native input validation
    pass
```

#### Task 1.2: Output Guardrails  
**Purpose**: Ensure agent responses meet quality and safety standards

**SDK Pattern**:
```python
class PaymentSupervisorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'payment_processor': PaymentOpsAgent(),
            'compliance': ComplianceSpecialist(), 
            'customer_service': CustomerServiceSpecialist(),
            'risk_analyst': RiskAnalystAgent()
        }
    
    async def route_request(self, user_query: str):
        # LLM decides which agent(s) to use
        routing_decision = await self.analyze_request(user_query)
        return await self.delegate_to_agent(routing_decision)
```

#### Task 3.2: Agent Memory & State Persistence

- **Performance Tracking**: Build knowledge about what works in different scenarios

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Create: `src/payment_ops/memory/session_memory.py` - In-memory context management
- Modify: All agent classes to integrate memory capabilities

**SDK Pattern**:
```python
class StatefulPaymentAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_memory = {
            'processed_payments': [],
            'customer_preferences': {},
            'successful_patterns': {},
            'failure_modes': {}
        }
    
    async def process_with_memory(self, payment_id: str):
        # Check previous context
        context = await self.retrieve_relevant_context(payment_id)
        
        # Process with learned patterns
        result = await self.process_payment(payment_id, context)
        
        # Store learnings
        await self.store_interaction_learnings(payment_id, result)
        return result
```

#### Task 3.3: Agent Self-Evaluation
**Purpose**: Enable agents to assess their own performance and adapt behavior

**Implementation Areas**:

- **Self-Escalation**: Automatically handoff when confidence is low
- **Basic Learning**: Simple pattern recognition for improvement

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Create: `src/payment_ops/evaluation/self_assessment.py` - Basic performance evaluation

class SelfEvaluatingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = {
            'success_rate': 0.0,
            'confidence_accuracy': 0.0,
            'handoff_appropriateness': 0.0
        }
    
    async def process_with_evaluation(self, payment_id: str):
        # Assess confidence before processing
        confidence = await self.assess_confidence(payment_id)
        
        if confidence < self.confidence_threshold:
            return await self.handoff_to_supervisor(
                reason="Low confidence", 
                confidence_score=confidence
            )
        
        result = await self.process_payment(payment_id)
        
        # Self-evaluate the result
        evaluation = await self.evaluate_result(result)
        await self.update_performance_metrics(evaluation)
        
        return result
```

**Success Criteria**:
